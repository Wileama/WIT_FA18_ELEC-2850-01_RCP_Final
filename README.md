# WIT_FA18_ELEC-2850-01_RCP_Final
Final project for WIT FA18 ELEC-2850 using the DEO media computer. The project is a variant on asteroids, using the ten switches to turn sub-systems, like weapons, shields, and life support on & off.

The Three push buttons are used to rotate the players ship left and right. In addition to thrusting the ship in the direction it is pointing

The ten switches turn on and off various sub-systems
1) Weapon system 1
2) Weapon system 2
3) Weapon system 3
4) Sheild generator 1
5) Sheild generator 2
6) Sheild generator 3
7) Engines
8) Radar
9) Life support
10) Liquid Droplet Radiator

Switches 1-3
weapon systems


switches 4-6
Shield generators


switch 7
Engines
allows the player to rotate the ship, and thrust forward. Produces heat.

switch 8
Radar
allows the player to see the various navigation hazards. Produces heat.

switch 9
Life Support
The life support system provides breathable air to the crew. If turned off the crew will begin depleting a small emergency reserve. Once the reserve is empty the crew will die, killing the player. While turned on the system produces heat, refills the emergency reserve, and keeps the crew alive.

switch 10
Liquid dropleet radiator
This system allows the ship to quickly radiate away larges amounts of heat energy using a special liquid with a low vapor. However it requires the ship to stop spinning and maintain a constant velocity. As a result switching this sub-system on will disable player control of the engine system. The computer will then fire the RCS to stop the ship from spinning. With this accomplished the ship will begin to radiate heat away.
